    "keywords": "FAQ Is a specific Role Center required for use of your application? In order to use Latvian Base Localization, no specific role center is required. Is there a list of basic settings to be completed for using your app? Basic necessary system setup for the use of Latvian Base Localization is created, when applying the configuration package LVI.LVI.STANDARD. For detailed guidance and images please review Help section: Configuration Package Import Our company does not have a Finance Manager only a CEO and Accountant. How we should configure company information? Select the Accountant employee card for Finance Manager. In case the Accounting Manager is not selected in Company Information, the in the printouts the Finance Manager data shall appear instead of Accounting Manager. By mistake we have entered two identical customer cards for a non-VAT payer company. Is there any kind of control on this? A non-VAT payer company has a company registration number. It is possible to setup registration number check for customers in Sales &Receivables Setup by selecting an option: None- registration number is not controlled; two or more customer cards may exist with the same customer company registration number Message – the system gives a message, if a user is entering a registration number for a customer that already exists in the system Error – Customer Company Registration number is required to be unique for customer cards Our company delivers goods to customer using transporters, but each time the servicing company provides a different vehicle. Is it possible not to use that catalogue? Yes, it is possible not to use the Transporter catalogue per each vehicle, you may enter the Transporting Company details in list of Transporters and add the vehicle information on sales/purchase/transfer documents by editing the field. For Printing Options use Print Transporter “From Document”. When we try to create a payment file from a payment journal, the lines turn red and the file is not created. What is the cause? Please refer to Payment File Export fact box, the system has a control at place, if any mandatory information required by bank payment rules is missing. The most common issues can be missing country codes and or company registration numbers for vendors, missing SWIFT code or IBAN in the Vendor Bank card; missing data in company information company registration number, country code; missing data in bank account card – country code, Bank account No., SWIFT code, IBAN. Our company is receiving foreign incoming payments from customers, in some cases we do not assign foreign payment code when transaction is posted. Is it possible to add the transaction to the foreign payment report afterwards? If the foreign payment code is not assigned when posting payment journal or reconciliation journal line, then the foreign payment code cannot be assigned to bank ledger entry afterwards. In such cases the entry needs to be reversed and posted once more, but with assigning the foreign payment code. The exchange rate services did not update the currency exchange rate in the morning. Can I upload the rates manually? In order to use the functionality manually, the following steps are required: Click on the button Search for Page or Report... Type Currencies and select Currencies from Pages and Tasks Press Import Currency Rates Define Import Currency Rates options Options: From Date – set the period start date for import To Date – set the period end date for import (by default is set to today) Curr.Exch. Rate Update Setup – select the setup code, that was uploaded in the system by LVI.LVI.Standard configuration package ECB-EXCHANGE-RATES When preparing foreign payment report, I receive a blank page, but we had foreign incoming payments for this period. What is wrong? The information in the report appears if only you have assigned the foreign payment code, before posting payment journal or payment reconciliation journal. If there are transactions posted without assigned foreign payment code, then the report comes blank as for there is no data for the report. We have printed a sales prepayment invoice from sales order and posted sales prepayment invoice. Currently we need to print LV Sales Prepayment Invoice once more, because the customer has lost it. After Sales prepayment invoice is posted, it is possible to print LV Sales Invoice from Posted Sales Invoice, but it will not indicate that it is a prepayment. According to the process, LV Sales Prepayment Invoice need to be printed before sales prepayment is posted. Sales prepayment invoice is posted only at the point, when sales prepayment is received, that ensures ability to print out LV Sales Prepayment Invoice from Sales Order. Values in Inventory Write-Off document do not match the values in Posted Inventory Write-Off document. What is the reason? When printing the document from unposted item journal lines, the unit cost may not be actual; therefore it is advised to print Posted Inventory Write-off document, using additional filters on item ledger entry in printing options for Item Ledger Entry. Fixed asset physical inventory document printout has lines for comments to be added, but there is no such option in printing options. How can I add the comments? Comments can be added by saving this document as Word file. When I export the payment file for bank from payment journal and upload it to banking online, the file is rejected because information to recipient. How can this be corrected? Number of symbols allowed in information to recipient vary from bank to bank, therefore go to particular payment journal line and remove some symbols in field Message to Recipient. Afterwards payment file needs to be exported once more and uploaded to Banking online."

Is a specific Role Center required for use of your application? In order to use Latvian Intrastat Reporting Localization, no specific role center is required, because the functionality can be accessed via search pane, whereas printout buttons are embedded inside ribbon under the tab ACTIONS. Why all my created sales, purchase, transfer documents that are related to EU receipts or shipments have the same Transaction types? It seems that the following is set in Intrastat Setup - Default Transaction Type - the default transaction type for regular sales shipments, service shipments, and purchase receipts - Default Transaction Type - Returns - default transaction type for sales returns, service returns, and purchase returns Why do I need to create a separate Intrastat Journal Batch per each reporting period? I can just change the statistics period in the default batch and reuse it! It is the best practice to use a new Intrastat Journal Batch per each reporting period, in order to have an audit trail of the data already reported. For this reason there is a possibility to mark an Intrastat Batch as Reported. Is there a possibility to set Default Tariff No. for Item cards? Otherwise, I need to go and update all item cards with Tariff No. before the system allows me to create Intrastat Journal. However all my items have the same commodity code. It is not supported by Intrastat Setup. Is there a possibility to have full list of Tariff No. in the system? Commodity codes is a large list that can be copied into Dynamics 365 Business Central from CSV file provided by Central Statistics Bureau. I was using Transport Method field, in order to specify the delivery service companies. Now my Intrastat Reports need to be corrected manually. Transport Method values are stipulated by Central Statistics Bureau and it is involved in Intrastat Reporting. For delivery services please use field \"Shipping Agent\" and \"Shipping Agent Services\". Intrastat Report needs to be corrected manually in Intrastat Journal, once it is created.."

Latvian VAT Reporting Localization is fully integrated with Dynamics 365 Business Central by extending its functionality and tailoring it to meet the requirements of local legislation and local business requirements.

In order to use Latvian VAT Reporting Localization, no specific role center is required. We received a purchase invoice with VAT standard rate for services from a Vendor for the amount 750.00 EUR excluding VAT and posted it. However there was a mistake in the invoice, therefore we posted corrective purchase credit memo, then posted the correct purchase invoice. In VAT Buffer I have all 3 documents, but there should be only 1. Why these documents appear in VAT Buffer? All 3 documents are suggested for VAT Buffer Lines, however when documents are applied to each other - posted purchase invoice and corrective purchase credit memo, then VAT Buffer adds a checkmark in the field Skip of VAT Buffer Lines. This ensures that initial wrong document and correction of this document neither to appear in VAT Statement Appendix printout, nor the VAT Statement Appendix export file. Therefore only the correct purchase invoice will appear in VAT Buffer Lines. I have successfully created VAT Buffer, checked it with Chart of Accounts and VAT Entries, then marked it as Released, in order to prepare for submission. But then received a delayed invoice from a Vendor, that is dated with the last day of reporting month, just before the submission deadline. How should I process it? The purchase invoice needs to be posted with last day of the previous month as posting date. Because posting date drives VAT entries. Once the lines are created in VAT Buffer, they are not updated, if any postings are done within the period, that is collected inside the VAT Buffer. In order to update the lines in VAt Buffer it is required to press \"Delete All Lines\" in Ribbon, then press \"Suggest Lines\" once more. After I have prepared VAT Buffer, I noted, that the VAT Registration No. of the counterparty was not completed. How can I fix this? The best practice is to enter the VAT Registration No. in Customer/Vendor card, then recreate the VAT Buffer lines. After I have prepared EC Sales List, I noted, that the VAT Registration No. of the Customer was not completed. How can I fix this? It is required to go to VAT entries, press \"Edit List\" in the Ribbon, then find the VAT entry of the deal and add the VAT Registration No. here. Afterwards, recreate EC Sales List Report. I have prepared VAT Return for a specific period, but when I try to export the file to Electronic Declaration system, I cannot assign the VAT Buffer and EC Sales List report - the lists are empty. Only VAT Buffer and EC Sales List Report with status \"Released\" can be assigned to file export. The periods of VAT Return, VAT Buffer and EC Sales List Reports should match."
